<div class="section">
<p>Welcome. Here is the course description from the RIT website:</p>

<em>
    <blockquote>
        Undergraduate Seminar in IGM is intended to allow for special one-time
        offerings of undergraduate topics or to allow faculty to pilot new
        undergraduate offerings. Specific course details (such as the course
        topics, format, resource needs, and credit hours) will be determined by
        the faculty member(s) who propose a given special-topics offering.
    </blockquote>
</em>

<p>This year, IGM Faculty have determined these details as folows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Topic</strong>: Advanced Projects in FOSS on the Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li><strong>Format</strong>: Projects based course with lecture and instruction</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Needs</strong>: Open Hardware and Open Educational Materials</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Hours</strong>: 3</li>
</ul>

<p>At the heart of this course are 5-week release cycles. Unlike the RIT HFOSS
course, that focuses on <strong>one</strong> large team project, this course
will have multiple tightly-scoped project releases (or "hacks".)
</p>


<div class="section padded">
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tbody><tr><th colspan="2"><h3>Release Cycle Breakdown</h3></th>
    </tr><tr><td>Week 1</td><td>Ideation and Proposal. Community Contribution Assigned.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Week 2</td><td>Development. Community Contribution Due.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Week 3</td><td>Development</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Week 4</td><td>Testing and Documentation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Week 5</td><td>Packaging and Release</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Each cycle will include a community contribution assignments, in addition to each hack.</p>

  <h2>Licensing</h2>
  <p>All code developed by students in the course must be licensed (by the student)
  under any one of the <a class="" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative</a>.</p>
  <p>Your code that you write is <strong>your</strong> code, with which you can do what you will;

<div class="section">
    <h2>Community Contributions</h2>
    <p>Not only will students be releasing their own projects, they will also
    be contributing to other projects and communities as well. These
    contributions will fall into one of four categories:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bugfixes</li>
        <li>Content</li>
        <li>Media</li>
        <li>Graphics</li>

  <h2>Course Grading</h2>
<p>Assignments are due at 4:59pm of the day they are marked as due, to be useful in class.</p>
<p>Late submissions will be deducted <span class="label label-danger">10%</span> per day they are late.</p>

    <p>Attendance is <em><strong>required</strong></em> for this course. Students are allotted <span class="label label-danger">2</span> <strong><u>excused</u></strong> absences per semester.</p>
    <p>Subsequent absences will result in a <span class="label label-danger">10%</span> reduction of your final letter grade <strong><em>for each</em></strong> class missed.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Blog updates</em> – students are required to keep a blog to which they post updates
about their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls. This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course <a href="/checkblogs">participant page</a> (there are instructions on how to do this
in <a class="" href="/hw/firstflight"><em>Homework - First Flight</em></a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>You must make at least one blog post per week to receive full credit. A week Ends on Sunday at 11:59pm.</li>

  <h2>Lightning Talks - Extra Credit</h2>
<p>Every class for the first portion of class, any student has the opportunity
to give a <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk">lightning talk</a></code> on a
topic of their chosing. Your lightning talk must be less than 5 minutes in
length and must be at least remotely related to the course material.</p>
<p>You will receive +1 extra credit points towards your final grade for every
lightning talk you give. Only the first <span class="label
label-success">2</span> lightning talks offered will be allowed during a given
class. Talks will be chosen from among those offered by students on a <code><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO">FIFO</a></code>
